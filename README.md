# HTTP Flood Attack Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Status
**This project is currently a work in progress.**  
The code, dataset, and configurations shared here are under development and subject to changes. 

## Description
This repository contains our thesis project files aimed at detecting HTTP flood attacks using machine learning. The project is an evolving effort to enhance intrusion detection systems by integrating supervised learning techniques.

## Dataset
- The datasets used in this project are sourced from publicly available websites and are utilized solely for educational and research purposes.
- No proprietary or restricted datasets are included in this repository.

## Current Progress
- Machine learning models have been developed and tested using the dataset.
- Integration with SNORT for real-time traffic analysis is ongoing.
- Documentation and further enhancements are in progress.

## Disclaimer
- This repository is **not** intended for production use. 
- The project is shared as-is for collaborative research purposes only.

## Future Updates
We plan to:
1. Finalize real-time testing with SNORT.
2. Include detailed documentation and configuration files.
3. Enhance the README with specific instructions and results.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/HTTP_Flood_Detection.git
